# Mouse Brain Receptor Uniformity Analysis

This repository contains **all code, processed data tables, and figure-generation outputs**
used in the manuscript:

> **Cross-regional uniformity of neurotransmitter receptor transcript detection across the adult mouse brain**

The analysis is based on publicly available single-cell RNA-seq data from the
**Allen Institute Adult Mouse Brain Cell Atlas (Cell Census v2023; WMB-10Xv3)**.

## Overview

**Cross-regional similarity is evaluated through a two-stage framework, comprising an
absolute-scale assessment based on upper-quantile summaries of percentage-point differences,
followed by a relative-scale evaluation of compositional similarity in log-ratio space using
Aitchison distances.**

**Cross-regional uniformity of neurotransmitter receptor transcript detection**  
*A quantitative framework for cross-regional uniformity*

This repository is a **methods-first, code-centric research artifact**.

The primary contribution is a **fully reproducible quantitative framework** for evaluating
cross-regional uniformity in **compositional molecular data**, with explicit uncertainty
estimation.

The accompanying manuscript (PDF) is provided as a **descriptive companion** to the
executable analysis pipeline; the authoritative research output is the code itself.

This repository provides a fully reproducible analysis pipeline for quantifying the degree of
cross-regional uniformity in neurotransmitter receptor–related transcript detection across
major macro-regions of the adult mouse brain.

Although the motivating application is biological, the **core contribution is methodological**:
a general framework for assessing *uniformity versus variation* in compositional data.

Specifically, the analysis integrates:

- **Compositional data analysis** (CLR transform, Aitchison geometry)
- **Absolute percentage-point difference metrics** (U75, U95)
- **Hierarchical bootstrap** for uncertainty quantification
- **Explicit region–pair–level summary statistics**

The framework is **not specific to particular genes or brain regions** and is extensible to
other molecular systems, brain structures, and cross-species comparisons.

## 🧠 Analytical Framework

The pipeline quantifies **cross-regional similarity (uniformity)** of neurotransmitter receptor–related transcript detection across **11 non‑cerebellar brain macro‑regions**.

Two complementary metrics are used:

1. **Gene-wise absolute percentage-point differences** (U75 / U95)
2. **Compositional distances** in CLR space (Aitchison distance)

Uncertainty is quantified using a **hierarchical bootstrap** (donor → cell).

## 🧪 Software Environment

All analyses were developed and executed under the following environment:

- **Python**: 3.12
- **NumPy**: 2.3.5
- **Pandas**: 2.3.3
- **Scanpy**: 1.11.5
- **Statsmodels**: 0.14.5
- **Matplotlib**: 3.10.7
- **Seaborn**: 0.13.2

This configuration ensures full reproducibility of the expressing-fraction calculations,
regional aggregation, compositional analyses, and hierarchical bootstrap procedures
reported in the manuscript.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Prepare Allen Brain Atlas `*-log2.h5ad` files locally
2. Edit the input path in the script:

```python
H5AD_DIR = Path("/path/to/WMB-10Xv3/log2_h5ad")
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the pipeline:

```bash
python src/Mouse_brain_receptor_uniformity_pipeline.py
```

All outputs will be written to:

```
WMB_receptor_uniformity_results/
```

In this repository, the files corresponding to the manuscript are already organized
under `data/` and `figures/` as described above.

## 🧾 Reproducibility Notes

- Detection rule: **log2(expression) > 0**, equivalent to **UMI > 0** for WMB‑10Xv3 data
- CLR transform uses a fixed pseudo‑count: δ = 1e‑6
- Random seed is fixed and recorded in `run_metadata.json`
- Software versions and parameters are logged in `analysis_log.txt`
